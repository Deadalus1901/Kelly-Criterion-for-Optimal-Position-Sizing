# Kelly-Criterion-for-Optimal-Position-Sizing

Position sizing is one of the most important aspects of trading.
The Kelly criterion is a formula that determines the optimal size for a bet. Itâ€™s the position size that maximizes the expected growth rate of an account. 
The Kelly criterion is valid when expected returns are known (it maximizes the expected growth rate). It also assumes you can make infinite bets.
